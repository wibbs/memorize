The first goal is to create a pattern that will blink in a specified order. 
This will be easy after figuring how to get a square to blink.
Currently when you click the mouse a random square will blink. However, it will stay gray if the same one blinks twice.
After two clicks 2 squares will blink. After 3 clicks 3 square will blink. etc etc
This is an easy fix. Just haven't had time

Now when you click down a memorization challenge will be built. Each time you click the mouse the challenge will get one block longer.
I have not added any logic for the user to punch in their attempt yet.
